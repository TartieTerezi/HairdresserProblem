# Hairdresser problem 

A hairdresser owns a very small salon\
there is only one chair in the work area\
and 4 stools in the waiting room\
the salon runs like this:
- when the hairdresser finishes a customer's haircut, the customer leaves
- the hairdresser then goes into the waiting room
if there are customers in the waiting room :
- the hairdresser then goes to the waiting room
if there are customers in the waiting room:
- he takes one of them, sits him/her on the chair in the work area and starts cutting
if there are no customers in the waiting room:
-  he returns to the workspace, and rests on his chair
when a customer arrives, he goes to see the hairdresser\
if the customer is asleep, he wakes him up and sits in the chair for an immediate cut\
if they're working, they sit in the waiting room\
if the waiting room is full, the customer leaves.
